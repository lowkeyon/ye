//Press the little circle in order to make it move
//The story is that the player is the boss managing an unstable individual circle in order to make it perform. The more pressure is put on the circle, the more it goes mad. Untile it is finally left alone to do whatever it pleases. When the player gives it some space it is like a vacation to breath and rest for a bit. That section isn't seen since the circle isn't seen by its boss (or player). Then the cycle begins again. The cycle is just pressur/stress that keeps building again and again in anything basically.
